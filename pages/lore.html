                    It is said that the world grew on a dew drop. And on that dew drop, everything came to be. First, as tiny creatures, and then over time, as what we know today. Much in the same way, we first were scattered in the breeze before we knew any better,
                    but we learned to talk, we learned to read, we wrote down our ideas, our thoughts, what we saw, and what we could do. And, we wrote about the dragonflys.

                    Dragonflys, unlike dragons, were silly little creatures that grew with us. As we walked through the world, their beating wings followed. As we navigated rivers and forests, their eyes scouted ahead. Some people swore they could talk with their dragonflys,
                    but that was mostly pretend...probably. For our people, dragonflys were as much of us as any Elder or baby. But there were those that grew jealous of our dragonflys, and there were some who feared them.

                    Too long ago, further than anyone can really remember, a great war was thrust upon us. A war to take our dragonflys. It was a terrible violence, and many died. There was suffering in our cities, and famine. Hunger enveloped us, but still we fought to keep
                    our dragonflys safe. To keep their beating wings near us. To let their eyes see for us. And, most important of all, to let their love for us keep our own hearts warm. When the war was finally over, there were few of us left, and even fewer dragonflys. 
                    A terrible curse to befall us, but we could not surrender to the evil of the world, so we feld. Far far away from our homelands in the marshes and meadows, deep into unknown forests where we could not be followed. And there we have remained. For our safety, and the safety of our dragonflys.

                <p class="t2 gen_text">
                    Many many years have passed, and without our marshes and meadows, our dragonflys have almost disappeared. With the passing of the last living dragonfly, all seemed lost. That is, until we found a clutch of eggs. Possibly the last in the world.
